A Small Space That Taught Me a Big Lesson in C Programming Today while solving a simple C programming problem, I faced something very unexpected â€” a single space made my whole program behave differently! 

I entered these inputs:
10
9999999999999
12.5
A

But the program didnâ€™t show A at the end!!!!!!!!
 It looked like nothing was printed for the last value. ðŸ¤”

ðŸ§  What Actually Happened
When we press Enter after typing a number, a hidden newline character (\n) stays in the input buffer.

So when scanf("%c", &d); runs, it doesnâ€™t wait for your input â€” it takes that leftover newline instead of the real character 'A'.

Thatâ€™s why it prints nothing!

âœ… The Simple Fix

Add a space before %c:
scanf(" %c", &d);

That space tells C to ignore any blank space or newline before reading the character.
 Now it works perfectly! 

ðŸ§© What I Learned
C is a low-level language, which means it doesnâ€™t hide whatâ€™s happening inside the computer.

 Even a small thing like a space or a newline can change how your program works.
This small bug helped me understand how input, memory, and data actually flow in C â€” and thatâ€™s what makes learning it so powerful.
