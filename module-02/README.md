## ðŸš€ C Programming â€“ Day 2

Today, I learned about **Operators** and **Conditional Statements** in C programming.

### ðŸ”¹ I explored different types of operators like:

- **Arithmetic Operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) â†’ for mathematical operations  
- **Relational Operators** (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) â†’ for comparing values  
- **Logical Operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) â†’ for combining conditions  
- **Conditional Operators** (`if`, `else if`, `else`) â†’ for decision-making

### ðŸ§  I also practiced:
- **if-else** and **nested if-else** statements to control the programâ€™s decision flow.  

---

Since I already know **JavaScript**, these topics felt a bit familiar â€” itâ€™s interesting to see how similar logic works in both **C** and **JS**! ðŸ’¡  

Every day Iâ€™m realizing how learning **C** helps me understand the **core foundation of programming** even better.
