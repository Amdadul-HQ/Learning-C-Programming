# 💻 Deep Dive Into Computer Storage and Data Types Through C Programming

As I progress with learning **C programming**, I have gained a deeper understanding of how data is represented and stored within a computer’s memory — a concept fundamental to both programming and computer science.

## 🔹 Key Technical Details I Learned

### 🧠 Data Storage Units
- 8 bits = 1 Byte  
- 1024 Bytes = 1 KB  
- 1024 KB = 1 MB  
- 1024 MB = 1 GB  
- 1024 GB = 1 TB

### 💾 Data Types in C and Their Memory Usage

| Data Type      | Memory (Bytes) | Description |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| `int`          | 4 bytes        | Stores integer values (up to roughly 10⁹) |
| `float`        | 4 bytes        | Used for single-precision floating-point numbers |
| `char`         | 1 byte         | Used for single characters (ASCII encoding) |
| `long long int`| 8 bytes        | Used for very large integers (up to approximately 10¹⁸) |
| `double`       | 8 bytes        | Double-precision floating-point number, provides higher accuracy |

### ⚙️ Memory and Format Specification

Understanding **format specifiers** in `printf` and `scanf` helps correctly manipulate and display data based on their types and sizes:

| Specifier | Used For | Example |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `%d`       | Integer (`int`) | `printf("%d", num);` |
| `%f`       | Float (`float`) | `printf("%f", pi);` |
| `%lf`      | Double (`double`) | `printf("%lf", val);` |
| `%lld`     | Long Long Integer (`long long int`) | `printf("%lld", bigNum);` |

### 🌍 Real-World Connection

These fundamentals explain how **digital data measurements** like **MB**, **GB**, and **TB** relate to:
- Storage capacity  
- Data transfer speeds  
- The **mobile internet data** we use daily  

Learning C didn’t just teach me syntax — it revealed **how computers think** and how every bit and byte contributes to the digital world we live in.
